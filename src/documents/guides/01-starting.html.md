### What do we need?

Nightscout is a project composed of several parts.

From a place of caution, the first place to start is that you acquire 2 Dexcom receivers.
The use of a CGM brings significant diabetes management advantage and it would be our first
priority not to lose any data. The CGM in the Cloud system is a very useful extension of that
data but the assembly has the disadvantage of potentially breaking the receiver charging port
if not protected well or handled roughly. Better to have a second receiver, so there is never
a time where you are without the CGM if one should break.

Next is the choice of android phone or tablet and cell data service provider and plan. Consider
what your main goals are and select equipment and service to minimize hassle and be successful.

Cords can be purchased online or locally. Check the Info sheet for specifics, it can be slightly
confusing when if selecting online.

Lastly, determine if you are DIY for the programming part. This group has fantastic support and
very knowledgeable members to reach out to for assistance. If you are not a DIY person and want
to have more assistance, that is possible through these wonderful group members as well.

The pebble watch is the last piece in this puzzle. It is optional and some find it very valuable
but without all of the previous pieces it will not work. 

Good Luck!
