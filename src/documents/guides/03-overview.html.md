### Dexcom G4 Receiver

**Important: the USB jack is very fragile.**
Many people have broken their jack. 

  1. If a cable is plugged into the jack and the receiver is dropped
     it may break
  1. Repeated plugging / unplugging may cause it to break
  1. Various hacks (styrofoam, fishing tackle cases, person game
     system cases, pouches) have been used to protect the cable
     connection.  Drilling a hole in the case above the jack and
     filling it with 5 minute epoxy may provide additional mechanical
     strength.
