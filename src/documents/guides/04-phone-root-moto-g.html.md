### Moto G phone – get a phone, unlock it, and root it

  1. Buy the version of the phone which will work with your preferred
     cellular provider

     *  Keep in mind this phone’s primary purpose is an uploader.
        Because it must remain connected to the Dexcom receiver which
        has a fragile USB connection, it is best to minimize its use an
        actual phone.

     The phone will need to be unlocked and “rooted” for the software
     to turn the USB power off between uploads (otherwise the Dexcom
     will charge, draining the phone’s battery)

  2. Set up web access (wifi, cellular)

     * Put the phone aside for a moment, and set up MongoLab
     * Do not upgrade the Android OS or return it to factory defaults,
       or the phone will need to be re-rooted.
