## Rooting is OPTIONAL

Most phones will work perfectly fine without rooting. Rooting (also known as "jailbreaking" in the iPhone world) voids your warranty, but the advantages include the ability to:

* Disable charging of the Dexcom receiver.
* Disable software that will use your Internet connection unnecessarily.
* Disable software that your kids might use to download games.

If you would like to read a novice's guide to Rooting, please read this article on Lifehacker entitled "[Everything You Need to Know About Rooting Your Android Phone](http://lifehacker.com/5789397/the-always-up-to-date-guide-to-rooting-any-android-phone)". This article includes links to where to find guides to rooting your phone.

Below are instructions for rooting a Motorola Moto G phone. If you have another phone, please see the "Where to Find Rooting Methods and Tools" section of the Lifehacker article mentioned above.

### Moto G phone – get a phone, unlock it, and root it

  1. Buy the version of the phone which will work with your preferred
     cellular provider

     *  Keep in mind this phone’s primary purpose is an uploader.
        Because it must remain connected to the Dexcom receiver which
        has a fragile USB connection, it is best to minimize its use an
        actual phone.

     The phone will need to be unlocked and “rooted” for the software
     to turn the USB power off between uploads (otherwise the Dexcom
     will charge, draining the phone’s battery)

  2. Set up web access (wifi, cellular)

     * Put the phone aside for a moment, and set up MongoLab
     * Do not upgrade the Android OS or return it to factory defaults,
       or the phone will need to be re-rooted.
