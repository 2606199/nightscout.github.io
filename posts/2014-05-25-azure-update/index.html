Azure account.</p>
<p>This applies only to people following Azure instructions from February
and March, April, but is useful in understanding how Azure charges for
free accounts.  These kinds of pricing/billing procedures are common
among &quot;cloud providers,&quot; let this serve as a detailed guide of Azure
services, circa <code>2014-05-25</code>.</p>
<p>There are other providers as well, also with free accounts.</p>
<h2 id="is-azure-free-account-working-">Is Azure free account working?</h2>
<p>Nightscout probably just stopped working for you.  Here&#39;s why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Circa <code>2014-05-25</code>, a month ago would be ~ <code>2014-04</code>, April.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>We set these up a month ago with the free trial version.  You put in
your credit card information.  What we missed is the fact that the free
trial expires after a month and doesn&#39;t convert automatically to the
&quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; version.  This is not a big deal because the daily use
of Nightscout still falls under the &quot;free use&quot; tier 99% of the time.
The only time it goes above this tier is when the alarm mp3s play over
and over again.  This has happened to us 3 times, always when <code>PWD</code>
has gotten out of range of the uploader and <code>...</code> was high or low at
the time, resulting in persistent alarms.  Nighscout contributors are
working on a permanent fix for this problem, likely involving the
addition of a simple browser cache expiry tag in the code.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<h2 id="fixing-logging-in">Fixing/ Logging in</h2>
<p>Do you have an Azure account?  Do you have an <code>@outlook.com</code> email
account specifically set up for Nightscout?  Did you free trial
expire?</p>
<p>You may have to talk to a live human at Microsoft.  Please let us know
on email if you do not.</p>
<p>Please log in to the outlook email accounts we set up for each of you,
and follow the instructions to convert to the &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; version.
The email addresses and passwords are in the emails we just sent
separately.</p>
<p>Login at <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com">http://www.windowsazure.com</a> with the azure username /
password for your &quot;nightscout credentials&quot; email.  You might have an
<code>@outlook.com</code> address associated with your nightscout.  Then call
<code>(800) 642 7676</code> with your username info close at hand, then ask them
to &quot;convert my free trial subscription to a pay-as-you-go subscription
so that my nightscout website will start working again&quot;.</p>
<p>In a perfect world, nightscout will just start running again.  If not,
please drop your favorite Nightscout contributor an email and we&#39;ll
figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-free-trials-work-">How do free trials work?</h2>
<p>The free trial for Azure lasts a month.  Sometime before the trial
ends, the subscription needs to be converted over to &quot;pay as you go&quot;
or the website will stop working.  After conversion, go in to
manage.windowsazure.com, click on the nightscout website, click on
&quot;SCALE&quot;, and select the FREE web hosting plan mode.  then click save
at the bottom. </p>
<p>Once the free trial is over, we need to subscribe to some other kind
of &quot;subscription.&quot;  We will choose <code>pay as we go</code> and aim to keep our
usage under the Free watermark for usage.</p>
<h3 id="credit-card-for-my-free-trial-vs-pay-as-we-go-">Credit card for my free trial vs pay as we go?</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t be concerned about credit card bills - this will still stay free
unless you start hosting a big data machine learning competition on
azure.  Little &#39;ole Nightscout doesn&#39;t use much bandwidth or CPU.
This not a big deal because the daily use of Nightscout still falls
under the &quot;free use&quot; tier 99% of the time.  The only time it goes
above this tier for us is when the alarm mp3s play over and over
again.  This has happened 3 times, always when <code>PWD</code> has gotten out of
range of the uploader and <code>[...]</code> was high or low at the time,
resulting in persistent alarms.  we would love to permanently fix for
this problem, likely involving the addition of a simple browser cache
expiry tag in the code (there is no need to re-send the big mp3 file
at every alarm).</p>
<h2 id="pay-as-you-go-">Pay as you go?</h2>
<p>Once again don&#39;t be concerned about credit card bills - this will
still stay free unless you start hosting a big data machine learning
competition on azure.  Little &#39;ole Nightscout doesn&#39;t use much
bandwidth or CPU.</p>
