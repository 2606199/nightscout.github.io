<p>Nightscout is a combination of community, comprised of people, with
technology, comprised of open source software and hardware.  Open
source software develops in a diverse &quot;Bazaar&quot;, a community of people
with diverse experiences and talents.  A theme that unites the
decentralized efforts and the diverse perspectives is is an
overwhelming desire to do everything possible to make &quot;Diabetes&quot; a
common enemy.  By making diabetes the common enemy, the community
provides a venue for beneficial collaborations to take place,
accelerating and improving diabetes therapy.</p>
<h3 id="designing-nightscout">Designing Nightscout</h3>
<p>Nightscout&#39;s design reflects the needs of the people who use
it because the users are co-developers and designers of the software.
Social media provides a way for everyone in the community to enhance
the software, and the community itself, making everyone safer in the process.</p>
<p>After interviewing developers, users, support, advocates of
Nightscout, surveying Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, IRC, Github, among
other social networks, and working extensively with the FDA over the
past year, I&#39;m proposing a roadmap intended to provide some oversight
and transparency for where Nightscout is likely headed.  Hopefully
this will also help people ascertain how and where they can help.
Jason Calabrese actually provided simple 3 step outline that
seems to represent the intentions of many community members in the
future:</p>
<h3 id="proposed-roadmap">Proposed Roadmap</h3>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Monitoring</strong> - Nightscout as-is</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving fidelity of therapy: allow predicting, targeting, and
reproducing desired A1C&#39;s, reducing hypoglycemias, increasing time
in range, restoring family dynamics, reduced burden through
ubiquitous, persistent, glanceable displays.</li>
<li>FDA approved, open source <del>class III</del> de novo medical device!,<ul>
<li>safe and effective</li>
<li>can promote use</li>
<li>can re-use work</li>
<li>will provide legitimacy, allow relationships, legalized growth</li>
<li>can publish to science journals, allow researchers to discover new
therapies</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>establishes groundwork IDE/IRB for researchers, new devices, can
re-submit previous FDA work for re-use! (eg provides re-usable
work to discuss DexDrip, MMCommander, DexBridge and others with
public, researchers, FDA)</li>
<li>enabling multiuser/auth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Predictors</strong>, towards an AP</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving fidelity of care: improving accuracy of insulin dosing.</li>
<li>understand, prove through prediction how glycemia works,
mathematically modeling influences on glucose.</li>
<li>create tools for optimizing, understanding basal rates, <code>I:C</code> and
<code>ISF</code> ratios and other related metrics.</li>
<li>working with clinics/doctors, Dr and patient work together with NS</li>
<li>educational focus</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>OpenAPs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Automating previous work through suggestions, high fidelity care.</li>
<li>IDE with FDA, re-using established process</li>
<li>Making open source AP easy to use, accessible</li>
<li>Dosing insulin properly using new, conservative, reviewed, safe
techniques</li>
<li>de novo FDA approval?, first class III open source device,
reviewable, understandable, by and for the world.  High fidelity
therapy.</li>
<li>dynamic basal</li>
<li>calendar, location integration</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="-wearenotwaiting-"><code>#wearenotwaiting</code></h3>
<p>What does <code>#wearenotwaiting</code> mean?  Will we wait for vendors to
integrate to Medtronic pumps with Dexcom Sensors?  Will we trust an
algorithm that we cannot improve and test ourselves?  Will we accept
arbitrary limits of 5 <code>&#39;Sharers&#39;</code>?  Will we take advantage of the
opportunities to work with vendors and FDA to improve the safety and
efficacy of our care?</p>
<p>The users and developers will adapt the technology to continue to meet
our needs.  Nightscout wasn&#39;t created out of a love for phones and
cables, it was created out of a desire to increase and promote safety.
We hope this roadmap helps provide some insight on how Nightscout
might change over time, what to expect in the future from the
community, as well as how to help.
