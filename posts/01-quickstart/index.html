<section class="block"><a id="guides-00-welcome_start"></a><div class="yielded"><h2><a href="/guides/00-welcome" class="doc-link">Welcome</a></h2><p>So you are thinking about a Nightscout rig?</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-nightscout-project-">What is the Nightscout project?</h2>
<p>Nightscout is an open source, <code>DIY</code> project.  There is no support or
any warranty of any kind.  The quality and performance of the project
is with you.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-project-for-me-">Is this project for me?</h2>
<p>No programming experience is required, but there are several caveats
to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>data may go missing without warning</li>
<li>data may be absent</li>
<li>data may be wrong</li>
<li>data may be delayed</li>
<li>you may void your warranty</li>
<li>you may break something</li>
</ul>
<p>For all these reasons and more, it is important everyone carefully
consider whether or not this project is right for them.</p>
<p>Right now, the best way to prepare yourself for a project of this
nature is to follow the guidelines, to feel comfortable configuring
and installing your own rig.  Having this experience will prepare you
to get help from the entire community quickly.</p>
<p>There is a community on Facebook that with people from all experience
levels who will help you get up to speed on understanding and
installing.  Some may even help you experiment with new features, or
different deployment techniques.  While we love to see the diversity
and Nightscout ecosystem grow, it is important that when asking for
help, people who might provide you help need have an understanding of
how things have been set up for you.  If you departed from the
community guides, it will be harder for people to help, potentially
leaving you with less help if something breaks or needs to be
upgraded.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-required-">What is required?</h2>
<p>A <strong>Dexcom receiver</strong>, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIyBpl6Z7iM"><strong>smartphone supporting USB
OTG</strong> support</a>.
A special <strong>USB OTG cable</strong> allows the 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_8c8d43mI8">smartphone to read and report Dexcom readings</a>
to the cloud.  The
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSGF4kQj7ck">Dexcom USB port is fragile</a>
and will break if you are not very very careful.  If you want the
uploading to work everywhere, the smartphone will need a cell data
plan.  The smartphone must support USB OTG.</p>
<p>The combination of the smartphone + Dexcom allows data to go to <strong>a
website, which you</strong> (or a friend?) <strong>will set up and manage</strong>.  It
will be your responsibility to make sure it continues to run.  Several
details need to be synchronized, using configuration menus in the UI
in several different applications, in order for the system to work.
The website will display the data from the cloud using a this website,
many devices will be able to access this website.</p>
<p>There is no privacy or security provided by these tools, all data you
upload will be publically available for anyone on the internet to
read.</p>
<p>So the minimum requirements for a Nightscout rig are: a website
managed by you, a smartphone, and a Dexcom.  With these components,
the CGM levels can be monitored from anywhere in the world.  The
website works on many other mobile devices, tablets, laptops; the sole
purpose is to display the data.  Due to the caveats mentioned and for
many other reasons, it is important to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wqwFCjobBo">not rely on this for therapy</a> .
.</p>
<p>Following the step by step guides should help prepare you for putting
everything together and learning how to use the system.</p>

<p>Nightscout is a project composed of several parts.</p>
<p>From a place of caution, the first place to start is that you acquire 2 Dexcom receivers.
The use of a CGM brings significant diabetes management advantage and it would be our first
priority not to lose any data. The CGM in the Cloud system is a very useful extension of that
data but the assembly has the disadvantage of potentially breaking the receiver charging port
if not protected well or handled roughly. Better to have a second receiver, so there is never
a time where you are without the CGM if one should break.</p>
<p>Next is the choice of android phone or tablet and cell data service provider and plan. Consider
what your main goals are and select equipment and service to minimize hassle and be successful.</p>
<p>Cords can be purchased online or locally. Check the Info sheet for specifics, it can be slightly
confusing when if selecting online.</p>
<p>Lastly, determine if you are DIY for the programming part. This group has fantastic support and
very knowledgeable members to reach out to for assistance. If you are not a DIY person and want
to have more assistance, that is possible through these wonderful group members as well.</p>
<p>The pebble watch is the last piece in this puzzle. It is optional and some find it very valuable
but without all of the previous pieces it will not work. </p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<p>Normally, mobile phones act as usb slaves.  This allows them to draw
power from the connected master, and allows the master to control
exchanging data such as music, pictures, and other files.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/xvKULj3.jpg" alt="normal-usb-slave"></p>
<p>The USB <code>OTG</code> cable allows the phone to switch roles, becoming the
master side of the connection.
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/1MNdt83.jpg" alt="mobile-otg-usb-master">
This allows the mobile phone to control the Dexcom and provide power,
just like a laptop.</p>

<ul>
<li>Dexcom G4 Receiver</li>
<li>Moto G phone (for uploading from the Dexcom)</li>
<li>Mongolab (for storing data on the cloud)</li>

<p><strong>Important: the USB jack is very fragile.</strong>
Many people have broken their jack. </p>
<ol>
<li>If a cable is plugged into the jack and the receiver is dropped
it may break</li>
<li>Repeated plugging / unplugging may cause it to break</li>
<li>Various hacks (styrofoam, fishing tackle cases, person game
system cases, pouches) have been used to protect the cable
connection.  Drilling a hole in the case above the jack and
filling it with 5 minute epoxy may provide additional mechanical
strength.</li>

<p>Most phones will work perfectly fine without rooting. Rooting (also known as &quot;jailbreaking&quot; in the iPhone world) voids your warranty, but the advantages include the ability to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable charging of the Dexcom receiver.</li>
<li>Disable software that will use your Internet connection unnecessarily.</li>
<li>Disable software that your kids might use to download games.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Buy the version of the phone which will work with your preferred
cellular provider</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep in mind this phone’s primary purpose is an uploader.
Because it must remain connected to the Dexcom receiver which
has a fragile USB connection, it is best to minimize its use an
actual phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>The phone will need to be unlocked and “rooted” for the software
to turn the USB power off between uploads (otherwise the Dexcom
will charge, draining the phone’s battery)

With Mongolab now set up, the application should be able to start
uploading.  Connect the Dexcom receiver to the Moto G.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: when connecting the phone to the Dexcom, the OTG cable
plugs into the phone, and the regular USB cable plugs into the
Dexcom.  It will not work the other way, because OTG cables have
pins 4 and 5 shorted on the microusb connector, the indication to
the phone that an OTG device is connected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During the initial connection, there may be a pop-up asking if the app
should have permission to run / access services.  Select yes.  The app
should load, and data should start flowing to Mongolab.</p>
<h4 id="-optional-creating-an-apk-"><strong>Optional: Creating an apk</strong></h4>
<p>Android Studio also provides a way to “package” the app as an apk,
which can then be attached to an email.  On Android devices, the gmail
app is smart enough to install apps which are attached to emails.  In
this way, it is very easy to deploy the app to other devices such as
tablets or micro pcs.  These are especially useful for bedside
monitoring, since they have their own source of external power.  For
more information, see:</p>

<h4 id="-important-verify-data-flowing-to-mongolab-"><strong>IMPORTANT: Verify Data Flowing to Mongolab</strong></h4>
<p>Before moving to the next step, you must verify that the data is flowing to Mongolab.  </p>
<p>First, ensure your Dexcom receiver is connected to your uploader device and that the app is uploading data (the dexcom blood glucose number and the uploader device&#39;s blood glucose number should match).  </p>
<p>With the app running, log into your Mongolab account.  On the home screen, you will see something like this:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/gzfIvKJ.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>If the data is reaching Mongolab, the number under the documents column will not be zero.</p>
<p>For more detailed information and troubleshooting, click on the database (anywhere in the gray bar of information) to locate your collection.  The next screen will look like this:
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l08MATw.png" alt="Alt text"></p>
<p>To view the actual documents/packets of information received including the date and time that Mongolab receives data, click on the collection name (blocked out on the screen shot) and you will see something like this:
